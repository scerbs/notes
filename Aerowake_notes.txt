active_mission_rotate:
    things to add:
        find bearing using current gps locations
        make sure code is easily modifiable to allow for active mission rotation given changing gps locations
            for this one it might be tough to actually do, because we will have to compare real locations with expected locations to decided whether or not we need to rotate
        should we add a way to check current missio/bearing? or just leave that for a GUI

    bugs:
        repeated rotate commands do not go through to the UAV, so gcs and UAV will have different bearings
            is this the behavior we want? might not make sense to continually input rotate commands
                this will become a problem if we implement a contiuous bearing check/rotate functionality, unless we find a different way to rotate then sending a command from gcs, could just be a local thing on the UAV that sends updated bearing to gcs
