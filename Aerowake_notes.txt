For acknowledgement, find pixhawk rover parameter that can be used by UAV to relay a message back to gcs.
  Found: ACRO_TURN_RATE
  if no acknowledgement received, try again (maybe once or twice) and if nothing return a message saying that
  issue: need to be constant checking if UAV changes a parameter, maybe using a callback?
  resolved: gcs only needs to check when a user input is sent (so can check inside gcs while loop)
    control code while loop (inside try statement) at very end, after valid input check
  how do we check that command has been received?
    need to keep track of previous state of parameter, if parameter doesn't change to what is expected, we know that command wasn't received
  what if same command is given twice?
    when second time a command is given in a row, the gcs will automatically think it has been received (parameter doesn't change)
    fix this by maybe resetting parameter to set value at start of control loop?
  UAV: need to write something within listening loop that will change a parameter if information received
    this one should be pretty easy, only change the parameter when a command is received, so change it right before executing, making use of the same loop
